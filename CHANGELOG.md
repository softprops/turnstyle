## 0.1.5

- Added feature to set the output `force_continued=true` when using `continue-after-seconds` so that only a subset of future steps can be skipped.

## 0.1.4

- Introduce `abort-after-seconds` input. This behaves much the way `continue-after-seconds` does but aborts from the workflow step rather than pushing onward. [#19](https://github.com/softprops/turnstyle/pull/19)
- Fix branch monitoring issue with `same-branch-only` when defaults inputs are provided [#20](https://github.com/softprops/turnstyle/pull/20)

## 0.1.3

- Introduce `same-branch-only` input, used to explicitly control whether a workflow runs should be synchronized across branches. The default remains `true` but can now be overridden to `false` [#7](https://github.com/softprops/turnstyle/pull/7)
- Favour `GITHUB_HEAD_REF` for branch name when present, typically the case for `pull_request` triggers [#8](https://github.com/softprops/turnstyle/pull/8)

## 0.1.2

- Query for previous runs at every iteration of the Waiter [#3](https://github.com/softprops/turnstyle/pull/4)

## 0.1.1

- Fix bug where `poll-interval-seconds` and `continue-after-seconds` where not getting parsed correctly as action inputs [#2](https://github.com/softprops/turnstyle/pull/2)

## 0.1.0

- Initial release
